## [2.0.0] - 2025-08-02

### üéâ Major Release - Provider-less Architecture

This is a complete rewrite of capacitor-firebase-kit with a provider-less architecture that works seamlessly across React, React Native, and Capacitor apps without requiring any providers or React Context.

### ‚ú® Added
- **Provider-less Architecture**: Implemented Zustand-like singleton pattern that doesn't require React Context
- **Universal Platform Support**: Now works on Web, React Native, Capacitor, and Node.js
- **Automatic Platform Detection**: Detects the platform and loads the appropriate adapter automatically
- **Dynamic Imports**: All Firebase SDKs are loaded on-demand to reduce bundle size
- **Tree-Shaking Support**: Only the services you use are included in your bundle
- **TypeScript Support**: Full TypeScript support with improved type definitions
- **Lazy Loading**: Services are only initialized when first accessed
- **Works in Server Components**: Can be used in Next.js server components and dynamic imports

### üîÑ Changed
- **BREAKING**: Changed from provider-based to provider-less API
- **BREAKING**: Capacitor is now an optional peer dependency
- **BREAKING**: New initialization API: `firebaseKit.initialize()` instead of provider setup
- **BREAKING**: Services are now accessed as methods: `firebaseKit.analytics()` instead of properties
- Updated all dependencies to latest versions
- Improved error handling with specific error codes
- Enhanced platform-specific implementations

### üóëÔ∏è Removed
- **BREAKING**: Removed React provider components
- **BREAKING**: Removed requirement for wrapping app in providers
- **BREAKING**: Removed direct Capacitor dependency (now optional)

### üì¶ Migration Guide

#### Before (v1.x)
```tsx
import { FirebaseKitProvider } from 'capacitor-firebase-kit';

<FirebaseKitProvider config={firebaseConfig}>
  <App />
</FirebaseKitProvider>

// In components
const { analytics } = useFirebaseKit();
analytics.logEvent('event_name');
```

#### After (v2.0)
```tsx
import firebaseKit from 'capacitor-firebase-kit';

// Initialize once
await firebaseKit.initialize(firebaseConfig);

// Use anywhere - no providers needed!
const analytics = await firebaseKit.analytics();
await analytics.logEvent('event_name');
```

### üêõ Fixed
